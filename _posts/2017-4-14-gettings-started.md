<h3>
As the PL season comes to a close, some clear winners and losers emerged. The title was decided, the fate was sealed for the last of the relegation spots, and the battle for Champions League soccer next season draws to a close.
Here is my take (I know you really care), of the biggest winners this week.  
</h3>

<h2>Winner - Michy Batshuayi (and Chelsea I guess) </h2> 
<h4>
40 Million Euros, 18 PL appearences, 2 goals. Those stats put Batshuayi probably in the category of biggest flops for this year.
But of course, timing is everything. The Belgian made his second goal count, scoring as a substitute to win the Chelsea their second
PL title in three years. To be fair he had a pretty easy tap in, but all credit to him. 
Who knows if he'll deliver on his price tag, but he's young and has shown that he can show up for big games. Just seeing the reaction of him and the whole Chelsea
side in contrast to the environment of last season is really a testament to what Conte has done for the club. Congratulations to Chelsea!

<h2>Winner - Spurs</h2>
<h4>
Personally, I've never that Spurs 'bottled' anything this season. Aside from a long run of draws, a stellar defense and the creativity of players like Eriksen and Kane
made Spurs a side whose consistency is only rivaled by Chelsea. With their win over United, they secured a very respectable second place finish. This is simply icing on the cake
after the cancellation of St. Totteringham's day. Pochettino has a young, promising, and exciting side, that appears to have only gotten better since last year. I don't see
the side getting picked apart this year, and I feel that this is confirmed with the general lack of substantive (when are they ever substantive) transfer rumors surrounding Spurs.
It makes sense, as Spurs can offer champions league football, a chance at silverware every year, and show no sign of decline. Whereas the likes of United and (sadly) Liverpool cannot offer.
If the giants like Madrid or Barca come knocking however, it would only be natural that some players would leave. Currently, Walker and Rose are linked with exits, but they represent the senior players on
the Spurs team, and the youngsters like Winks and Trippier would have a chance to step up. All in all, Spurs have had a great season, and show no sign of slowing down. I am truly scared of 
them in the years to come...

<h2>Winner - Swansea City </h2>
<h4>
Somehow they did it. After being by far the worst team in the league for months, Paul Clement reinvigorated a Swansea side that seemed hopeless in the previous months.
After Guidolin and Monk failed to build off of Monk's mostly good work, I had condemned Swansea by the end of 2016 to make the drop. While they were aided with beneficial results
from the other relegation candidates, today they solidified another year in the top flight. While I am dissapointed that Bob Bradley couldn't represent America well on the world's 
biggest stage, I am happy for Swansea. They may have regressed a lot from their eight place finish in 2015, but they have a talented squad, a squad I feel is to good for the Championship.
I just hope they can do better then Borja Baston this summer, and keep a hold of Sigurdsson.

<h3>
This was a pretty exciting week for the prem. Manchester United are out of the top four race, and no all the pressure is on Wenger to deliver another year with a top four finish. Next week will be the culmination
of the Champions League battle, as City, Arsenal, and Liverpool all grapple for the two remaining spots.
